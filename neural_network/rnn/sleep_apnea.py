Application of artificial intelligence in the diagnosis of sleep apnea.

Sleep apnea is characterized by repetitive episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea)
cessation of breathing during sleep. There are two mechanistic categories of sleep apnea-obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),
which is characterized by upper airway blockage during sleep with continued respiratory effort, and central sleep apnea, 
in which both airflow and inspiratory effort are absent or reduces. Sleep apnea is a major health issue associated with different
forms of cardiovascular disease including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. The standard test for the diagnosis of sleep
apnea is polysomnography (PSG) during which patients need to sleep overnight at a sleep laboratory. However, more recently home sleep
testing is increasingly by being used to diagnose OSA. The most commonly used type of home sleep testing device records airflow, respiratory
effort, oxygen saturation, and heart rate.



Portable sleep apnea syndrome screening and event detection using long short-term memory recurrent neural network.
Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by repeated airflow partial reduction or complete
cessation due to upper airway collapse during sleep. OSAHS induce frequent awake and intermittent hypoxia
that is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular events. Moreover, a long short-term memory recurrent
neural network model is proposed to classify four types of sleep breathing patterns, namely obstructive sleep apnea(OSA
), central sleep apnea (CSA), hypopnea(HYP) events and normal breathing (NOR).

According to a recent report, 13% men and 6% women between the ages of 3o and 70 years are affected by obstructive sleep
apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Patients suffering from OSAHS have symptoms such as excessive daytime sleepiness, morning
headache, hypertension and decreased libido. However, people are often unaware of OSAHS because apnea/hypopnea events only
occur during sleep. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine scoring manual, an apnea events is identified when
a drop of 90% respiratory airflow lasts for at least 10s with at least 3% associated decrease in oxygen saturation (SpO2) or
arousal from sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) which is defined as the total number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour
of sleep, is a vital metric to quantize the severity of sleep breathing disorder.
